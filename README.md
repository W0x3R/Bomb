## *The world collapsed when the king of&nbsp;hell took over. Everyone who tried to&nbsp;stop him before you is&nbsp;dead. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;end this once and for all, you need to&nbsp;click on&nbsp;the button above. After you click on&nbsp;it, the spell book will open and the summoning of&nbsp;the king of&nbsp;hell will begin. Remember that once you click, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;going back. If&nbsp;you still dare to&nbsp;press, then you will need to&nbsp;catch 10&nbsp;pentagrams in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;this terrible creature once and for all. Be&nbsp;careful and persistent, the king of&nbsp;hell will try in&nbsp;every possible way to&nbsp;interfere with you, moving the pentagram to&nbsp;different parts of&nbsp;the screen.<br> Good luck.*
